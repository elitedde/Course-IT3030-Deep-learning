**Project #1: Implementing autoencoder and VAE**


This assignment is about generative models – that is, models that are able to generate new
examples of data that “look like” your training data. I use two different models, that at
least to some extent can be seen as generative models:

• Standard auto-encoders

• Variational auto-encoders (VAEs)
